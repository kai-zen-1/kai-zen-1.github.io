## Bio
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley (graduation expected in May 2024). My areas of focus are labor, personnel and public economics. My research is on information asymmetries in the labor market, and in particular explores the extent of differences among firms in their ability to screen for new hire quality, and how this affects workers' careers.

Prior to my graduate studies, I was a policy analyst at the Australian Department of the Treasury. I received a Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Economics (Honors First Class and the University Medal) from the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia).
