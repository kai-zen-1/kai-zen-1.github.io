## Bio
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. My areas of focus are labor, personnel and public economics. My research focuses on information asymmetries in the labor market, especially those among firms when they screen for and hire new workers. My expected graduation is May 2024.

Prior to my graduate studies, I was a policy analyst at the Australian Department of the Treasury. I received a Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Economics (Honors First Class and the University Medal) from the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia).
